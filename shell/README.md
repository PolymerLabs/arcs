## Notes

### URL Parameters

`user=<userid>`
  * Force a particular user.
  * Most recent user is persisted in _localStorage_
  * Shell will remove this parameter from the URL after setting the user
    (so one can share a URL without forcing a user).
* `solo=<url>`
  * Use the manifest at `url` to supply recipes instead of the default set.
* `serial[=true]`
  * Use serializations to load Arcs, instead of step playback.
* `log[=<0, 1, 2...>]`
  * Set the shell's logging level. Default is 0 (off).
* `arc=<key>`
  * Load the arc stored at `key`
* `search=<search terms>`
  * Preload `search terms` as the Suggestion search.
