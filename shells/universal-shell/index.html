    UniversalShell represents an application that utilizes Arcs Runtime running in another process.
    This UniversalShell is actually a web page, but it could be a Java application, a Node application,
    or something else.
  </span>
  <br>
  <span>
    UniversalShell communicates with ArcsRuntime via the PipesShell bus; this API is fundamentally simple,
    only consists of sending requests and receiving responses.
