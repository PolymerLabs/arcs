# Developer Shell

A harness for directly executing arcs. It provides a number of in-browser "files": a single
manifest and multiple particle files. On-disk files can be used via imports in the manifest:

- Relative to the arcs serving root:
  - `import 'https://$arcs/SomeTopLevel.recipe'`

- Relative to the `particles` directory:
  - `import 'https://$particles/Tutorial/3_JsonStore/JsonStore.recipe'`

You can also seed the manifest file with one or more imports using the URL query parameter 
`m` (or `manifest`):

  - `http://localhost:8080/shells/dev-shell/?m=https://$arcs/particles/Profile/FavoriteFood.recipes;https://$arcs/particles/Stardate/Stardate.recipes`

Every recipe found will be executed in a separate arc. Repeated executions are independent.
Changes to any of the input files (in-browser or on disk) will be picked up on each execution.

Pressing `ctrl-enter` in any file panel is a shortcut for clicking `execute`.

The stores created by an arc can be viewed and updated using the ðŸ—„ button, and the serialization
for an arc can be displayed by with ðŸ“„. The stores update in real time, but the serialization needs
to be closed and re-opened to refresh.

The in-browser files can be exported as a combined text file (saving as multiple files is usually
blocked by the browser, and I would prefer not to add a client-side dependency on zip or tar).
