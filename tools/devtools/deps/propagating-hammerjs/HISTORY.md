# History

- Fixed #6: stopPropagation not binding to the original event.


## 2016-01-13, version 1.4.5

- Made `propagating-hammerjs` more robust against removing/attaching a DOM
  element in the DOM whilst executing a touch event of the DOM element itself.


## 2016-01-04, version 1.4.4

- Upgraded to Hammer.js v2.0.6.
  - Replaced usage of `Hammer.extend` with `Hammer.assign`.
- Fixed not working in case of multiple instances of propagating-hammerjs on
  the same DOM element. Thanks @jsdw.


## 2015-06-04, version 1.4.3

- Fixed `dragend` events not being emitted correctly in case of multiple
  nested handlers.


## 2015-06-02, version 1.4.2

- Fixed not being able to overload options when having overridden the global
  Hammer instance.


## 2015-04-20, version 1.4.1

- Fixed not being able to handle both a tap and double tap.


## 2015-04-17, version 1.4.0

- Extended the option `preventDefault` with values `'mouse'`, `'touch'`,
  and `'pen'` to prevent default behavior for a specific type of device.


## 2015-04-14, version 1.3.0

## 2015-01-29, version 1.2.1

- Added an event property `event.firstTarget`, always containing the element
  where a gesture started.
