# A basic script to clean all of the build artifacts and installed
# modules.  Order matters, and it's easy to overlook something. In the
# future this could be structured to be done via a single
# one-build-tool-to-rule-them-all command, but currently we've a
# plethora of tooling and this is at least a starting point.
