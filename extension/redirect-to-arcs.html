<title>Arcs: Chrome Extension Redirect</title>

<!--
  By default the extension runs against a local server. To start one, go
  into the arcs directory and run:

  arcs> npm start
-->
<meta http-equiv="refresh"
      content="0; http://localhost:8080/shell/apps/web/?arc=*">

<!--
  Alternately, you can run against the latest deployed version. Comment out
  the redirect above, and uncomment this one:

<meta http-equiv="refresh"
      content="0; https://polymerlabs.github.io/arcs-live/shell/apps/chrome-extension/?arc=*">
-->
