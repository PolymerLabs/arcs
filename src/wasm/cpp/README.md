# C++ --> WASM particles

## Setup

Our C++ code is built by Bazel. You will need to install Bazel, and use it to
build and run the wasm code/tests (everything under `src/wasm/`).

1. **Installing Bazel:** run the `tools/setup` script to install Bazel on Linux
   (or otherwise look at that script to see which version of Bazel to download
   and how to set it up).

## Build

See [here](particles/WasmTemplate) for a working example.

- Add a `BUILD` file in the relevant directory
- Generate a C++ header file from your particle spec using the `arcs_cc_schema`
  build rule:
  ```
  arcs_cc_schema(
      # Name of the BUILD rule (tell Bazel to build this schema using this name).
      name = "example_schema",
      # Input source.
      src = "example.arcs",
      # Optional output filename.
      out = "example.h",
  )
  ```
- Write your C++ particle(s)
  - Include the Arcs C++ header: `#include "src/wasm/cpp/arcs.h"`.
  - Include your generated schema header(s): `#include "particles/WasmTemplate/example.h"`.
  - Particles inherit from `arcs::Particle` and use `arcs::Singleton` and
    `arcs::Collection`
- Add a `wasm_cc_binary` build rule for your C++ particle(s) to your `BUILD`
  file:
  ```
  cc_wasm_binary(
      # Name of the BUILD rule (tell Bazel to build this particle using this name).
      name = "example_particle",
      # Input C++ particle source files to compile.
      srcs = ["example.cc"],
      # Input C++ header files (example.h was generated by the example_schema rule above).
      hdrs = ["example.h"],
      # Other C++ dependencies this binary depends on (just the Arcs library).
      deps = ["//src/wasm/cpp:arcs"],
  )
  ```
- Build your particle using Bazel: `bazel build //particles/WasmTemplate:example_particle`.


## Execute

- `npm start`
- Visit [localhost:8786/shells/dev-shell/?m=https://$arcs/particles/WasmTemplate/example.arcs](http://localhost:8786/shells/dev-shell/?m=https://$arcs/particles/WasmTemplate/example.arcs)
