// These type parameters are wrapped up into a single CRDTTypeRecord interface
// that can be extended as a unit by CRDT implementation. This allows users
// of CRDT classes to be generic on a single type parameter. 
//
// Note that this interface and its subclasses are intended never to be
// implemented; instead they are a convenient way of associating the set of types
// required in a CRDT implementation together.

//    (change from this model to merged model, change from other model to merged model).
//    Note that merge updates the model it is invoked on; the modelChange return value is 
//    a record of a change that has already been applied.
//  - apply an operation. This might fail (e.g. if the operation is out-of-order), in which case
//    applyOperation() will return false.
//  - report on internal data
//  - report on the particle's view of the data.
//
// It is possible that two models can't merge. For example, they may have had divergent operations apply.
// This is a serious error and will result in merge throwing a CRDTError.
