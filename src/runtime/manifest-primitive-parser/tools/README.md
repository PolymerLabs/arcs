Playground
==========

Usage
-----

Open `playground.html` from any HTTP server that includes `arcs` in it's document root. Does not work if opened from the filesystem (requires http protocol).

Using the DevServer
-------------------

The Arcs DevServer can open the playground:

```
$ tools/sigh devServer
```

Then open `http://localhost:8786/build/runtime/manifest-primitive-parser/tools/playground.html/` in a web browser.
