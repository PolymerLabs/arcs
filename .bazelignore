# Some npm modules include their own WORKSPACE/BUILD files, so we need to ignore
# them from our build. Manually listing them is not ideal, but we can't ignore
# the entire node_modules folder, because we need it for our bazel builds.

# Shell deploy scripts create symlinks to directories which include BUILD files.
# These fail to resolve, so we need to ignore them too.
