## Introduction

This is a sample of how to write particles in Java and compile them to JS
using J2CL [https://github.com/google/j2cl]. 

See [https://github.com/google/j2cl/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md] for 
J2CL usage in general.

### Getting Started

* Run ```sudo install_dependencies.sh``` to install bazel and ibazel.
* Then run either ```build.sh``` to compile manually, or ```hotreload.sh``` to recompile-on-save.
* Launch Arcs Shell (npm start) and look for the 'J2clTest' recipe.
