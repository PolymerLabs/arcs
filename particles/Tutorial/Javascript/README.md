# Hello, World!

Welcome to developing using Arcs! By using Arcs as the platform for your system, you are choosing to value user sovereignty and leverage AI.  To get started, please obtain the project through [Github](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/arcs) using the instructions available there. For debugging purposes, we highly recommend having the [Arcs Explorer Chrome Extension](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/arcs/tree/master/devtools) also installed.

Before we get to code, it is important that we are all speaking the same language, so we present two definitions to start.

>- *Particle* - Modular component of functionality. Ideally small units so particles can be interchangeable. 
>- *Recipe* - A combination of particles to create features and systems.

Particles and recipes are defined using the Arcs Manifest Language and implemented in Javascript, Kotlin, or C++.  The best way to understand this is to jump into some code. Let’s look at how Hello World is implemented.

To start off with, we’re going to need two files, an Arcs manifest file (.arcs file) and a particle implementation in your language of choice. It’s easiest if we create a folder to house these files so we don’t lose them. As a matter of convention, particles live in the arcs/particles folder. Go ahead and create a new folder in there called ‘HelloWorld’.

Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything at the moment, we’ll be going over all of this in more detail throughout this tutorial. Let’s walk through these files line by line, starting with the .arcs file. You should create this file in your folder. By convention, .arcs files are camel case, so it should be called `HelloWorld.arcs` or something similar.
```
// The file begins by defining our particle. We can see the
// particle is implemented in HelloWorld.js, and therefore
// can assume it is a Javascript implementation.
particle HelloWorldParticle in 'HelloWorld.js'
  // Notice the tab that starts this line. Whitespace matters
  // in the Arcs manifest language, so this is very important.
  // Don't worry about what this line does at the moment, we'll
  // be getting to root and slots in more detail soon.
  consume root

// And now we are at the recipe definition!
recipe HelloWorldRecipe
  // Once again, notice the tab. This line tells us that the
  // HelloWorldRecipe contains a HelloWorldParticle.
  HelloWorldParticle
  // Finally, we provide a human readable description for the
  // recipe. This is optional, but will make it much easier and
  // nicer to debug. Once again, notice the tab.
  description `Tutorial 1: Hello World`
```

Alright, we’ve got our Arcs manifest file set. Now onto the Javascript. Just like the .arcs file, this should be in your HelloWorld folder. We set the file name in the .arcs file above to be `HelloWorld.js`.

```javascript
// To define a particle that interacts with the DOM, we use this boilerplate.
defineParticle(({SimpleParticle, html}) => {
 return class extends SimpleParticle {
   // Getter function which returns static HTML to display. In later tutorials 
   // we'll see how to use the templating functionality this provides.
   get template() {
     // You can use the html helper like so to render HTML:
     return html`<b>Hello, world!</b>`;
   }
 };
});
```

Once you have Arcs on your computer, run `npm start` in command line, then navigate to [http://localhost:8786/shells/dev-shell/?m=https://$particles/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.arcs](http://localhost:8786/shells/dev-shell/?m=https://$particles/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.arcs)

And that’s it! Congratulations, you have written your first program in Arcs!

# Template Interpolation Exploration

Alright, you’ve made your first Arcs program. But now it’s time to go make something! We are going to need a few more Arcs features to create anything of substance.

To get started, we want a way to make our UI dynamic. Simply returning static HTML is fairly boring. As with our Hello World program, we use `get template()` to return our base set of HTML, however we want to be able to update this in some way. To do so, we use the `render()` method and template interpolation. To make certain we are all speaking the same language, let’s define template interpolation within Arcs:

> *Template Interpolation* - A mechanism to substitute formatted data into renderable elements.

This interpolation occurs when `render()` returns a dictionary with keys that match elements in the template. The best way to explain how this works is to see it in action. The Arcs manifest file looks pretty much the same as with our Hello World example.

```
particle BasicTemplateParticle in 'basic-template.js'
  consume root

recipe BasicTemplateRecipe
  BasicTemplateParticle
  description `Javascript Tutorial 2: Basic Templates`
```

Meanwhile, the Javascript looks quite different, as this is where the magic occurs:
```javascript
defineParticle(({SimpleParticle, html}) => {  
 return class extends SimpleParticle {
   get template() {
     // You can set placeholders in your template like so: {{name}}. The render
     // function is where these placeholders are overridden.
     // NOTE: Each placeholder needs to be enclosed inside its own HTML element
     // (here, a <span>).
     return html`<b>Hello, <span>{{name}}</span>!</b>`;
   }

   render() {
     // Returns a dictionary, mapping from placeholder name to value.
     return {name: 'Human'};
   }
 };
});
```

Now your code should say “Hello, Human!”. You can update this by changing what `render()` returns. In upcoming tutorials, we will see how this can be updated based on user input.
