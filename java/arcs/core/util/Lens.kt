/**
 * A miniature lightweight "Optics" utility for Arcs. Mostly used for modifying immutable graph
 * data structures used by the [Allocator].
 *
 * # Lens
 * A lens is a kind of optic in functional programming that allows immutable data structures to
 * be updated compactly and elegantly. A [Lens] is constructed around a data structure and
 * allows its focus target (e.g. field member of a type) to be fetched, modified, or set.
 *
 * A [Lens] can be created easily by the [lens] function around a reference to a property, followed
 * by a code block to copy-construct a class with the modification.
 *
 * ## Example
 * ```kotlin
 * data class Person(name: String, age: Int)
 * val nameLens = lens(Person::name) { t,f -> t.copy(name = f) }
 *
 * val newPerson = nameLens.set(Person("John", 26), "Tom") // result: Person("Tom", 26)
 * val name = nameLens.get(newPerson)                      // result: "Tom"
 * val bang = nameLens.mod(newPerson) { "$it!" }           // result: "Tom!"
 * ```
 *
 * ## Composition
 * Two or more lens can be composed for deep object graph mutation.
 * ```kotlin
 * data class Manager(name: String, employee: Person)
 *
 * val employeeLens = lens(Manager::employee) { t,f -> t.copy(employee = f) }
 * val employeeName = employeeLens + nameLens
 * val manager = Manager("Sally", person)
 * val newManager = employeeName.set(manager, "Rita") // Manager("Sally", Person("Rita", 26))
 * ```
 *
 * ## Traversals
 * When you have a collection field, you need a lens with multiple focii, which is where
 * [Traversal] comes in. It allows you to mutate each member of a collection field (List or Map)
 * constructing a new collection. In the case of [Map], the map values are traversed, the keys
 * are left intact.
 *
 * ## Example: Modify the age of each child
 * ```kotlin
 * data class Parent(name: String, children: List<Person>)
 * val parent = Parent("Mary", listOf(Person("Jack", 4), Person("Jill", 3)))
 * val childrenLens = lens(Parent::children) { t, f = t.copy(children = f) }
 * val ageLens = lens(Person::age) { t,f -> t.copy(age = f) }
 *
 * val allChildren = childrenLens.traverse()
 * val newParent = allChildren.mod(parent) { it.copy(name = "Baby ${it.name}") }
 * // newParent = Parent("Mary", listOf(Person("Baby Jack", 4), Person("Baby Jill", 3)))
 * ```
 *
 * ## Traversal Composition
 * A [Traversal] can be combined with a [Lens], or a another [Traversal] to reach deep into
 * nested data structures.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val allChildrenAges = allChildren + ageLens
 * val newParent = allChildrenAges.mod(parent) { it + 1 }
 * // newParent = Parent("Mary", listOf(Person("Jack", 5), Person("Jill", 4)))
 * ```
 *
