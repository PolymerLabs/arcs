/**
 * A [WriteBack] implementation for unit tests.
 *
 * Specifically it possesses the identical logic as [StoreWriteBack]s' but
 * adopts a special coroutine scope [TestCoroutineScope] which is required
 * for unit tests where no additional coroutine [Job]s are allowed active
 * after each [Test]. This is checked after each [Test] iteration and would
 * block the test itself till a timeout when there are pending/active [Job]s.
 *
 * E.g., runBlockingTest exception:
 * java.lang.IllegalStateException: This job has not completed yet
 * The workaround is configuring coroutine scope to [TestCoroutineScope]
 *
