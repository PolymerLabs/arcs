/**
 * Base implementation of Arcs handles on the runtime.
 *
 * A handle is in charge of translating SDK data operations into the appropriate CRDT operation,
 * and then forwarding them to a [StorageProxy].
 *
 * This handle implementation is different from the [Handle] hierarchy defined in [arcs.sdk]. This
 * handle knows about CRDTs and how to interface with storage. Eventually, the SDK-side [Handle]
 * instances will map to an instance based on this class in the runtime (similar to the current
 * strategy for wasm, in which Kotlin-wasm particles map to an instance of a storageNG handle
 * in the JS/TS runtime).
 *
 * Note: A possible eventual goal is that this becomes the single runtime [Handle] implementation,
 * targetting any runtime platform that Kotlin targets. For the moment, though, this is just
 * used by JVM/Android hosts.
 *
 * Implementations using this base are assumed to be based on a [CrdtModel] type. Concrete
 * subclasses should select a [CrdtData] and [CrdtOperation] type for the [Handle] when
 * implementing a concrete version of it, and expose only the consumer type [T].
