 * sent from the [ActiveStore] to the driver (using [send]).
 *
 * This threading is used to track whether driver state has changed while the [ActiveStore] is processing
 * a particular model. [send] should always fail if the version isn't exactly `1` greater than the
 * current internal version.
 *
 * Note that the [Driver] is *not* a thread-safe interface! Calls to [registerReceiver] and [send]
 * should take place from the same thread that creates the Driver.
