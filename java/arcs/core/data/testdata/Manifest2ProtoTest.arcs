// This files is a part of 3 files suite of testdata:
// - Manifest2ProtoTest.arcs (this file)
// - Manifest2ProtoTest.pb.bin
// - Manifest2ProtoTest.textproto
//
// On the TypeScript side we serialize .arcs file and validate it equals the .pb.bin file.
// On the Kotlin side we deserialize .pb.bin and validate it equals parsed .textproto file.
// This provides an additional guarantee beyond unit tests that at least all the constructs used
// in the .arcs file can be serialized in TS and deserialized in Kotlin to the extent that they
// are present in the .textproto file.
