// A simple cycle doesn't prevent claims from propagating
// This test is a simple chain of particles, where the start of the chain
// makes a claim and the end of the chain checks it, but with a cycle in
// the middle of it. The cycle shouldn't stop the claim from propagating.
// #Ingress: P1
// #OK
