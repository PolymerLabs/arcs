// An online shop needs a service to process orders. However, the order item SKU is
// considered sensitive information and needs to be redacted.
// In this recipe, we demonstrate how one can use type variables to build a redactor
// particle.

  namespace: arcs.showcase.typevariables

// This is an ingress particle. It brings order data into the system.
particle OrderIngestion in '.OrderIngestion'
  data: writes [Product {sku: Text, name: Text, price: Number}]

// Type variables are used here to ensure that only need-to-know data is passed to
// the particle. `SkuRedactor` only has knowledge of the input handle's `sku` field
// (any schema after `with` clause we call a "constraint"). Yet, all of the rest of
// the fields will flow through the particle into the output handle. The input and
// output handles of the same variable name can be of any type as long as
// constraints are met.
particle SkuRedactor in '.SkuRedactor'
  input: reads [~a with {sku: Text}]
  output: writes [~a]
  claim output is redactedSku

// The shop processes orders in the consumer service. It has confidence that the sku
// is redacted due to the check on the data handle.
particle Consumer in '.Consumer'
