The `iron-location` element manages binding to and from the current URL.

iron-location is the first, and lowest level element in the Polymer team's
routing system. This is a beta release of iron-location as we continue work
on higher level elements, and as such iron-location may undergo breaking
changes.

#### Properties

When the URL is: `/search?query=583#details` iron-location's properties will be:

  - path: `'/search'`
  - query: `'query=583'`
  - hash: `'details'`

These bindings are bidirectional. Modifying them will in turn modify the URL.

iron-location is only active while it is attached to the document.

#### Links

While iron-location is active in the document it will intercept clicks on links
within your site, updating the URL pushing the updated URL out through the
databinding system. iron-location only intercepts clicks with the intent to
open in the same window, so middle mouse clicks and ctrl/cmd clicks work fine.

You can customize this behavior with the `urlSpaceRegex`.

#### Dwell Time

iron-location protects against accidental history spamming by only adding
entries to the user's history if the URL stays unchanged for `dwellTime`
milliseconds.

`app-location` is an element that provides synchronization between the
browser location bar and the state of an app. When created, `app-location`
elements will automatically watch the global location for changes. As changes
occur, `app-location` produces and updates an object called `route`. This
`route` object is suitable for passing into a `app-route`, and other similar
elements.

An example of the public API of a route object that describes the URL
`https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-location`:

    {
      prefix: '',
      path: '/elements/app-location'
    }

Example Usage:

    <app-location route="{{route}}"></app-location>
    <app-route route="{{route}}" pattern="/:page" data="{{data}}"></app-route>

As you can see above, the `app-location` element produces a `route` and that
property is then bound into the `app-route` element. The bindings are two-
directional, so when changes to the `route` object occur within `app-route`,
they automatically reflect back to the global location.

### Hashes vs Paths

By default `app-location` routes using the pathname portion of the URL. This has
broad browser support but it does require cooperation of the backend server. An
`app-location` can be configured to use the hash part of a URL instead using
the `use-hash-as-path` attribute, like so:

    <app-location route="{{route}}" use-hash-as-path></app-location>

### Integrating with other routing code

There is no standard event that is fired when window.location is modified.
`app-location` fires a `location-changed` event on `window` when it updates the
location. It also listens for that same event, and re-reads the URL when it's
fired. This makes it very easy to interop with other routing code.

So for example if you want to navigate to `/new_path` imperatively you could
call `window.location.pushState` or `window.location.replaceState` followed by
firing a `location-changed` event on `window`. i.e.

    window.history.pushState({}, null, '/new_path');
    window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('location-changed'));

`app-route` is an element that enables declarative, self-describing routing
for a web app.

> *n.b. app-route is still in beta. We expect it will need some changes. We're counting on your feedback!*

In its typical usage, a `app-route` element consumes an object that describes
some state about the current route, via the `route` property. It then parses
that state using the `pattern` property, and produces two artifacts: some `data`
related to the `route`, and a `tail` that contains the rest of the `route` that
did not match.

Here is a basic example, when used with `app-location`:

    <app-location route="{{route}}"></app-location>
    <app-route
        route="{{route}}"
        pattern="/:page"
        data="{{data}}"
        tail="{{tail}}">
    </app-route>

In the above example, the `app-location` produces a `route` value. Then, the
`route.path` property is matched by comparing it to the `pattern` property. If
the `pattern` property matches `route.path`, the `app-route` will set or update
its `data` property with an object whose properties correspond to the parameters
in `pattern`. So, in the above example, if `route.path` was `'/about'`, the value
of `data` would be `{"page": "about"}`.

The `tail` property represents the remaining part of the route state after the
`pattern` has been applied to a matching `route`.

Here is another example, where `tail` is used:

    <app-location route="{{route}}"></app-location>
    <app-route
        route="{{route}}"
        pattern="/:page"
        data="{{routeData}}"
        tail="{{subroute}}">
    </app-route>
    <app-route
        route="{{subroute}}"
        pattern="/:id"
        data="{{subrouteData}}">
    </app-route>

In the above example, there are two `app-route` elements. The first
`app-route` consumes a `route`. When the `route` is matched, the first
`app-route` also produces `routeData` from its `data`, and `subroute` from
its `tail`. The second `app-route` consumes the `subroute`, and when it
matches, it produces an object called `subrouteData` from its `data`.

So, when `route.path` is `'/about'`, the `routeData` object will look like
this: `{ page: 'about' }`

And `subrouteData` will be null. However, if `route.path` changes to
`'/article/123'`, the `routeData` object will look like this:
`{ page: 'article' }`

And the `subrouteData` will look like this: `{ id: '123' }`

`app-route` is responsive to bi-directional changes to the `data` objects
they produce. So, if `routeData.page` changed from `'article'` to `'about'`,
the `app-route` will update `route.path`. This in-turn will update the
`app-location`, and cause the global location bar to change its value.

`iron-icons` is a utility import that includes the definition for the `iron-icon` element, `iron-iconset-svg` element, as well as an import for the default icon set.

The `iron-icons` directory also includes imports for additional icon sets that can be loaded into your project.

Example loading icon set:

    <link rel="import" href="../iron-icons/maps-icons.html">

To use an icon from one of these sets, first prefix your `iron-icon` with the icon set name, followed by a colon, ":", and then the icon id.

Example using the directions-bus icon from the maps icon set:

    <iron-icon icon="maps:directions-bus"></iron-icon>

    To load a subset of icons from one of the default `iron-icons` sets, you can
    use the [poly-icon](https://poly-icon.appspot.com/) tool. It allows you
    to select individual icons, and creates an iconset from them that you can
    use directly in your elements.

See [iron-icon](#iron-icon) for more information about working with icons.

See [iron-iconset](#iron-iconset) and [iron-iconset-svg](#iron-iconset-svg) for more information about how to create a custom iconset.

`iron-meta` is a generic element you can use for sharing information across the DOM tree.
It uses [monostate pattern](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MonostatePattern) such that any
instance of iron-meta has access to the shared
information. You can use `iron-meta` to share whatever you want (or create an extension
[like x-meta] for enhancements).

The `iron-meta` instances containing your actual data can be loaded in an import,
or constructed in any way you see fit. The only requirement is that you create them
before you try to access them.

Examples:

If I create an instance like this:

    <iron-meta key="info" value="foo/bar"></iron-meta>

Note that value="foo/bar" is the metadata I've defined. I could define more
attributes or use child nodes to define additional metadata.

Now I can access that element (and it's metadata) from any iron-meta instance
via the byKey method, e.g.

    meta.byKey('info');

Pure imperative form would be like:

    document.createElement('iron-meta').byKey('info');

Or, in a Polymer element, you can include a meta in your template:

    <iron-meta id="meta"></iron-meta>
    ...
    this.$.meta.byKey('info');

The `<iron-flex-layout>` component provides simple ways to use
[CSS flexible box layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes),
also known as flexbox. This component provides two different ways to use flexbox:

1. [Layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).
The layout class stylesheet provides a simple set of class-based flexbox rules, that
let you specify layout properties directly in markup. You must include this file
in every element that needs to use them.

    Sample use:

    ```
    <custom-element-demo>
      <template>
        <script src="../webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js"></script>
        <next-code-block></next-code-block>
      </template>
    </custom-element-demo>
    ```

    ```html
    <link rel="import" href="iron-flex-layout-classes.html">
    <style is="custom-style" include="iron-flex iron-flex-alignment"></style>
    <style>
      .test { width: 100px; }
    </style>
    <div class="layout horizontal center-center">
      <div class="test">horizontal layout center alignment</div>
    </div>
    ```

2. [Custom CSS mixins](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/blob/master/iron-flex-layout.html).
The mixin stylesheet includes custom CSS mixins that can be applied inside a CSS rule using the `@apply` function.

Please note that the old [/deep/ layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/classes)
are deprecated, and should not be used. To continue using layout properties
directly in markup, please switch to using the new `dom-module`-based
[layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).
Please note that the new version does not use `/deep/`, and therefore requires you
to import the `dom-modules` in every element that needs to use them.

A complete [guide](https://elements.polymer-project.org/guides/flex-layout) to `<iron-flex-layout>` is available.

The `iron-icon` element displays an icon. By default an icon renders as a 24px square.

Example using src:

    <iron-icon src="star.png"></iron-icon>

Example setting size to 32px x 32px:

    <iron-icon class="big" src="big_star.png"></iron-icon>

    <style is="custom-style">
      .big {
        --iron-icon-height: 32px;
        --iron-icon-width: 32px;
      }
    </style>

The iron elements include several sets of icons.
To use the default set of icons, import `iron-icons.html` and use the `icon` attribute to specify an icon:

    <link rel="import" href="/components/iron-icons/iron-icons.html">

    <iron-icon icon="menu"></iron-icon>

To use a different built-in set of icons, import the specific `iron-icons/<iconset>-icons.html`, and
specify the icon as `<iconset>:<icon>`. For example, to use a communication icon, you would
use:

    <link rel="import" href="/components/iron-icons/communication-icons.html">

    <iron-icon icon="communication:email"></iron-icon>

You can also create custom icon sets of bitmap or SVG icons.

Example of using an icon named `cherry` from a custom iconset with the ID `fruit`:

    <iron-icon icon="fruit:cherry"></iron-icon>

See [iron-iconset](iron-iconset) and [iron-iconset-svg](iron-iconset-svg) for more information about
how to create a custom iconset.

See the [iron-icons demo](iron-icons?view=demo:demo/index.html) to see the icons available
in the various iconsets.

To load a subset of icons from one of the default `iron-icons` sets, you can
use the [poly-icon](https://poly-icon.appspot.com/) tool. It allows you
to select individual icons, and creates an iconset from them that you can
use directly in your elements.

### Styling

The following custom properties are available for styling:

Custom property | Description | Default
----------------|-------------|----------
`--iron-icon` | Mixin applied to the icon | {}
`--iron-icon-width` | Width of the icon | `24px`
`--iron-icon-height` | Height of the icon | `24px`
`--iron-icon-fill-color` | Fill color of the svg icon | `currentcolor`
`--iron-icon-stroke-color` | Stroke color of the svg icon | none

`iron-a11y-announcer` is a singleton element that is intended to add a11y
to features that require on-demand announcement from screen readers. In
order to make use of the announcer, it is best to request its availability
in the announcing element.

Example:

    Polymer({

      is: 'x-chatty',

      attached: function() {
        // This will create the singleton element if it has not
        // been created yet:
        Polymer.IronA11yAnnouncer.requestAvailability();
      }
    });

After the `iron-a11y-announcer` has been made available, elements can
make announces by firing bubbling `iron-announce` events.

Example:

    this.fire('iron-announce', {
      text: 'This is an announcement!'
    }, { bubbles: true });

Note: announcements are only audible if you have a screen reader enabled.

`<iron-input>` is a wrapper to a native `<input>` element, that adds two-way binding
and prevention of invalid input. To use it, you must distribute a native `<input>`
yourself. You can continue to use the native `input` as you would normally:

    <iron-input>
      <input>
    </iron-input>

    <iron-input>
      <input type="email" disabled>
    </iron-input>

### Two-way binding

By default you can only get notified of changes to a native `<input>`'s `value`
due to user input:

    <input value="{{myValue::input}}">

This means that if you imperatively set the value (i.e. `someNativeInput.value = 'foo'`),
no events will be fired and this change cannot be observed.

`iron-input` adds the `bind-value` property that mirrors the native `input`'s '`value` property; this
property can be used for two-way data binding.
`bind-value` will notify if it is changed either by user input or by script.

    <iron-input bind-value="{{myValue}}">
      <input>
    </iron-input>

Note: this means that if you want to imperatively set the native `input`'s, you _must_
set `bind-value` instead, so that the wrapper `iron-input` can be notified.

### Validation

`iron-input` uses the native `input`'s validation. For simplicity, `iron-input`
has a `validate()` method (which internally just checks the distributed `input`'s
validity), which sets an `invalid` attribute that can also be used for styling.

To validate automatically as you type, you can use the `auto-validate` attribute.

`iron-input` also fires an `iron-input-validate` event after `validate()` is
called. You can use it to implement a custom validator:

    var CatsOnlyValidator = {
      validate: function(ironInput) {
        var valid = !ironInput.bindValue || ironInput.bindValue === 'cat';
        ironInput.invalid = !valid;
        return valid;
      }
    }
    ironInput.addEventListener('iron-input-validate', function() {
      CatsOnly.validate(input2);
    });

You can also use an element implementing an [`IronValidatorBehavior`](/element/PolymerElements/iron-validatable-behavior).
This example can also be found in the demo for this element:

    <iron-input validator="cats-only">
      <input>
    </iron-input>

### Preventing invalid input

It may be desirable to only allow users to enter certain characters. You can use the
`allowed-pattern` attribute to accomplish this. This feature
is separate from validation, and `allowed-pattern` does not affect how the input is validated.

    // Only allow typing digits, but a valid input has exactly 5 digits.
    <iron-input allowed-pattern="[0-9]">
      <input pattern="\d{5}">
    </iron-input>

<!--
`<paper-input-container>` is a container for a `<label>`, an `<iron-input>` or
`<textarea>` and optional add-on elements such as an error message or character
counter, used to implement Material Design text fields.

For example:

    <paper-input-container>
      <label slot="label">Your name</label>
      <iron-input slot="input">
        <input>
      </iron-input>
      // In Polymer 1.0, you would use `<input is="iron-input" slot="input">` instead of the above.
    </paper-input-container>

You can style the nested `<input>` however you want; if you want it to look like a
Material Design input, you can style it with the --paper-input-container-shared-input-style mixin.

Do not wrap `<paper-input-container>` around elements that already include it, such as `<paper-input>`.
Doing so may cause events to bounce infinitely between the container and its contained element.

### Listening for input changes

By default, it listens for changes on the `bind-value` attribute on its children nodes and perform
tasks such as auto-validating and label styling when the `bind-value` changes. You can configure
the attribute it listens to with the `attr-for-value` attribute.

### Using a custom input element

You can use a custom input element in a `<paper-input-container>`, for example to implement a
compound input field like a social security number input. The custom input element should have the
`paper-input-input` class, have a `notify:true` value property and optionally implements
`Polymer.IronValidatableBehavior` if it is validatable.

    <paper-input-container attr-for-value="ssn-value">
      <label slot="label">Social security number</label>
      <ssn-input slot="input" class="paper-input-input"></ssn-input>
    </paper-input-container>


If you're using a `<paper-input-container>` imperatively, it's important to make sure
that you attach its children (the `iron-input` and the optional `label`) before you
attach the `<paper-input-container>` itself, so that it can be set up correctly.

### Validation

If the `auto-validate` attribute is set, the input container will validate the input and update
the container styling when the input value changes.

### Add-ons

Add-ons are child elements of a `<paper-input-container>` with the `add-on` attribute and
implements the `Polymer.PaperInputAddonBehavior` behavior. They are notified when the input value
or validity changes, and may implement functionality such as error messages or character counters.
They appear at the bottom of the input.

### Prefixes and suffixes
These are child elements of a `<paper-input-container>` with the `prefix`
or `suffix` attribute, and are displayed inline with the input, before or after.

    <paper-input-container>
      <div slot="prefix">$</div>
      <label slot="label">Total</label>
      <iron-input slot="input">
        <input>
      </iron-input>
      // In Polymer 1.0, you would use `<input is="iron-input" slot="input">` instead of the above.
      <paper-icon-button slot="suffix" icon="clear"></paper-icon-button>
    </paper-input-container>

### Styling

The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:

Custom property | Description | Default
----------------|-------------|----------
`--paper-input-container-color` | Label and underline color when the input is not focused | `--secondary-text-color`
`--paper-input-container-focus-color` | Label and underline color when the input is focused | `--primary-color`
`--paper-input-container-invalid-color` | Label and underline color when the input is is invalid | `--error-color`
`--paper-input-container-input-color` | Input foreground color | `--primary-text-color`
`--paper-input-container` | Mixin applied to the container | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-disabled` | Mixin applied to the container when it's disabled | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-label` | Mixin applied to the label | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-label-focus` | Mixin applied to the label when the input is focused | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-label-floating` | Mixin applied to the label when floating | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-input` | Mixin applied to the input | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-input-disabled` | Mixin applied to the input when the component is disabled | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-input-focus` | Mixin applied to the input when focused | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-input-invalid` | Mixin applied to the input when invalid | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-input-webkit-spinner` | Mixin applied to the webkit spinner | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-input-webkit-clear` | Mixin applied to the webkit clear button | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-input-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator` | Mixin applied to the webkit calendar picker indicator | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-ms-clear` | Mixin applied to the Internet Explorer clear button | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-underline` | Mixin applied to the underline | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-underline-focus` | Mixin applied to the underline when the input is focused | `{}`
`--paper-input-container-underline-disabled` | Mixin applied to the underline when the input is disabled | `{}`
`--paper-input-prefix` | Mixin applied to the input prefix | `{}`
`--paper-input-suffix` | Mixin applied to the input suffix | `{}`

This element is `display:block` by default, but you can set the `inline` attribute to make it
`display:inline-block`.

`<paper-input-error>` is an error message for use with `<paper-input-container>`. The error is
displayed when the `<paper-input-container>` is `invalid`.

    <paper-input-container>
      <input pattern="[0-9]*">
      <paper-input-error slot="add-on">Only numbers are allowed!</paper-input-error>
    </paper-input-container>

### Styling

The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:

Custom property | Description | Default
----------------|-------------|----------
`--paper-input-container-invalid-color` | The foreground color of the error | `--error-color`
`--paper-input-error`                   | Mixin applied to the error        | `{}`

Material design: [Text fields](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/text-fields.html)

`<paper-input>` is a single-line text field with Material Design styling.

    <paper-input label="Input label"></paper-input>

It may include an optional error message or character counter.

    <paper-input error-message="Invalid input!" label="Input label"></paper-input>
    <paper-input char-counter label="Input label"></paper-input>

It can also include custom prefix or suffix elements, which are displayed
before or after the text input itself. In order for an element to be
considered as a prefix, it must have the `prefix` attribute (and similarly
for `suffix`).

    <paper-input label="total">
      <div prefix>$</div>
      <paper-icon-button slot="suffix" icon="clear"></paper-icon-button>
    </paper-input>

A `paper-input` can use the native `type=search` or `type=file` features.
However, since we can't control the native styling of the input (search icon,
file button, date placeholder, etc.), in these cases the label will be
automatically floated. The `placeholder` attribute can still be used for
additional informational text.

    <paper-input label="search!" type="search"
        placeholder="search for cats" autosave="test" results="5">
    </paper-input>

See `Polymer.PaperInputBehavior` for more API docs.

### Focus

To focus a paper-input, you can call the native `focus()` method as long as the
paper input has a tab index. Similarly, `blur()` will blur the element.

### Styling

See `Polymer.PaperInputContainer` for a list of custom properties used to
style this element.

The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:

Custom property | Description | Default
----------------|-------------|----------
`--paper-input-container-ms-clear` | Mixin applied to the Internet Explorer reveal button (the eyeball) | {}

`<iron-dropdown>` is a generalized element that is useful when you have
hidden content (`dropdown-content`) that is revealed due to some change in
state that should cause it to do so.

Note that this is a low-level element intended to be used as part of other
composite elements that cause dropdowns to be revealed.

Examples of elements that might be implemented using an `iron-dropdown`
include comboboxes, menubuttons, selects. The list goes on.

The `<iron-dropdown>` element exposes attributes that allow the position
of the `dropdown-content` relative to the `dropdown-trigger` to be
configured.

    <iron-dropdown horizontal-align="right" vertical-align="top">
      <div slot="dropdown-content">Hello!</div>
    </iron-dropdown>

In the above example, the `<div>` assigned to the `dropdown-content` slot will be
hidden until the dropdown element has `opened` set to true, or when the `open`
method is called on the element.

Material design: [Dropdown buttons](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-dropdown-buttons)

`paper-menu-button` allows one to compose a designated "trigger" element with
another element that represents "content", to create a dropdown menu that
displays the "content" when the "trigger" is clicked.

The child element assigned to the `dropdown-trigger` slot will be used as the
"trigger" element. The child element assigned to the `dropdown-content` slot will be
used as the "content" element.

The `paper-menu-button` is sensitive to its content's `iron-select` events. If
the "content" element triggers an `iron-select` event, the `paper-menu-button`
will close automatically.

Example:

    <paper-menu-button>
      <paper-icon-button icon="menu" slot="dropdown-trigger"></paper-icon-button>
      <paper-listbox slot="dropdown-content">
        <paper-item>Share</paper-item>
        <paper-item>Settings</paper-item>
        <paper-item>Help</paper-item>
      </paper-listbox>
    </paper-menu-button>

### Styling

The following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:

Custom property | Description | Default
----------------|-------------|----------
`--paper-menu-button-dropdown-background` | Background color of the paper-menu-button dropdown | `--primary-background-color`
`--paper-menu-button` | Mixin applied to the paper-menu-button | `{}`
`--paper-menu-button-disabled` | Mixin applied to the paper-menu-button when disabled | `{}`
`--paper-menu-button-dropdown` | Mixin applied to the paper-menu-button dropdown | `{}`
`--paper-menu-button-content` | Mixin applied to the paper-menu-button content | `{}`

Material design: [Surface reaction](https://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/responsive-interaction.html#responsive-interaction-surface-reaction)

`paper-ripple` provides a visual effect that other paper elements can
use to simulate a rippling effect emanating from the point of contact.  The
effect can be visualized as a concentric circle with motion.

Example:

    <div style="position:relative">
      <paper-ripple></paper-ripple>
    </div>

Note, it's important that the parent container of the ripple be relative position, otherwise
the ripple will emanate outside of the desired container.

`paper-ripple` listens to "mousedown" and "mouseup" events so it would display ripple
effect when touches on it.  You can also defeat the default behavior and
manually route the down and up actions to the ripple element.  Note that it is
important if you call `downAction()` you will have to make sure to call
`upAction()` so that `paper-ripple` would end the animation loop.

Example:

    <paper-ripple id="ripple" style="pointer-events: none;"></paper-ripple>
    ...
    downAction: function(e) {
      this.$.ripple.downAction(e.detail);
    },
    upAction: function(e) {
      this.$.ripple.upAction();
    }

Styling ripple effect:

  Use CSS color property to style the ripple:

    paper-ripple {
      color: #4285f4;
    }

  Note that CSS color property is inherited so it is not required to set it on
  the `paper-ripple` element directly.

By default, the ripple is centered on the point of contact.  Apply the `recenters`
attribute to have the ripple grow toward the center of its container.

    <paper-ripple recenters></paper-ripple>

You can also  center the ripple inside its container from the start.

    <paper-ripple center></paper-ripple>

Apply `circle` class to make the rippling effect within a circle.

    <paper-ripple class="circle"></paper-ripple>

Material design: [Dropdown menus](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-dropdown-buttons)

`paper-dropdown-menu` is similar to a native browser select element.
`paper-dropdown-menu` works with selectable content. The currently selected
item is displayed in the control. If no item is selected, the `label` is
displayed instead.

Example:

    <paper-dropdown-menu label="Your favourite pastry">
      <paper-listbox slot="dropdown-content">
        <paper-item>Croissant</paper-item>
        <paper-item>Donut</paper-item>
        <paper-item>Financier</paper-item>
        <paper-item>Madeleine</paper-item>
      </paper-listbox>
    </paper-dropdown-menu>

This example renders a dropdown menu with 4 options.

The child element with the slot `dropdown-content` is used as the dropdown
menu. This can be a [`paper-listbox`](paper-listbox), or any other or
element that acts like an [`iron-selector`](iron-selector).

Specifically, the menu child must fire an
[`iron-select`](iron-selector#event-iron-select) event when one of its
children is selected, and an [`iron-deselect`](iron-selector#event-iron-deselect)
event when a child is deselected. The selected or deselected item must
be passed as the event's `detail.item` property.

Applications can listen for the `iron-select` and `iron-deselect` events
to react when options are selected and deselected.

### Styling

The following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:

Custom property | Description | Default
----------------|-------------|----------
`--paper-dropdown-menu` | A mixin that is applied to the element host | `{}`
`--paper-dropdown-menu-disabled` | A mixin that is applied to the element host when disabled | `{}`
`--paper-dropdown-menu-ripple` | A mixin that is applied to the internal ripple | `{}`
`--paper-dropdown-menu-button` | A mixin that is applied to the internal menu button | `{}`
`--paper-dropdown-menu-input` | A mixin that is applied to the internal paper input | `{}`
`--paper-dropdown-menu-icon` | A mixin that is applied to the internal icon | `{}`

You can also use any of the `paper-input-container` and `paper-menu-button`
style mixins and custom properties to style the internal input and menu button
respectively.

Material design: [Lists](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/lists.html)

`<paper-item>` is an interactive list item. By default, it is a horizontal flexbox.

    <paper-item>Item</paper-item>

Use this element with `<paper-item-body>` to make Material Design styled two-line and three-line
items.

    <paper-item>
      <paper-item-body two-line>
        <div>Show your status</div>
        <div secondary>Your status is visible to everyone</div>
      </paper-item-body>
      <iron-icon icon="warning"></iron-icon>
    </paper-item>

To use `paper-item` as a link, wrap it in an anchor tag. Since `paper-item` will
already receive focus, you may want to prevent the anchor tag from receiving
focus as well by setting its tabindex to -1.

    <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/" tabindex="-1">
      <paper-item raised>Polymer Project</paper-item>
    </a>

If you are concerned about performance and want to use `paper-item` in a `paper-listbox`
with many items, you can just use a native `button` with the `paper-item` class
applied (provided you have correctly included the shared styles):

    <style is="custom-style" include="paper-item-shared-styles"></style>

    <paper-listbox>
      <button class="paper-item" role="option">Inbox</button>
      <button class="paper-item" role="option">Starred</button>
      <button class="paper-item" role="option">Sent mail</button>
    </paper-listbox>

### Styling

The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:

Custom property               | Description                                  | Default
------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------
`--paper-item-min-height`     | Minimum height of the item                   | `48px`
`--paper-item`                | Mixin applied to the item                    | `{}`
`--paper-item-selected-weight`| The font weight of a selected item           | `bold`
`--paper-item-selected`       | Mixin applied to selected paper-items        | `{}`
`--paper-item-disabled-color` | The color for disabled paper-items           | `--disabled-text-color`
`--paper-item-disabled`       | Mixin applied to disabled paper-items        | `{}`
`--paper-item-focused`        | Mixin applied to focused paper-items         | `{}`
`--paper-item-focused-before` | Mixin applied to :before focused paper-items | `{}`

### Accessibility

This element has `role="listitem"` by default. Depending on usage, it may be more appropriate to set
`role="menuitem"`, `role="menuitemcheckbox"` or `role="menuitemradio"`.

    <paper-item role="menuitemcheckbox">
      <paper-item-body>
        Show your status
      </paper-item-body>
      <paper-checkbox></paper-checkbox>

Material design: [Menus](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/menus.html)

`<paper-listbox>` implements an accessible listbox control with Material Design styling. The focused item
is highlighted, and the selected item has bolded text.

    <paper-listbox>
      <paper-item>Item 1</paper-item>
      <paper-item>Item 2</paper-item>
    </paper-listbox>

An initial selection can be specified with the `selected` attribute.

    <paper-listbox selected="0">
      <paper-item>Item 1</paper-item>
      <paper-item>Item 2</paper-item>
    </paper-listbox>

Make a multi-select listbox with the `multi` attribute. Items in a multi-select listbox can be deselected,
and multiple item can be selected.

    <paper-listbox multi>
      <paper-item>Item 1</paper-item>
      <paper-item>Item 2</paper-item>
    </paper-listbox>

### Styling

The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:

Custom property | Description | Default
----------------|-------------|----------
`--paper-listbox-background-color`   | Menu background color                                            | `--primary-background-color`
`--paper-listbox-color`              | Menu foreground color                                            | `--primary-text-color`
`--paper-listbox`                    | Mixin applied to the listbox                                        | `{}`

### Accessibility

`<paper-listbox>` has `role="listbox"` by default. A multi-select listbox will also have
`aria-multiselectable` set. It implements key bindings to navigate through the listbox with the up and
down arrow keys, esc to exit the listbox, and enter to activate a listbox item. Typing the first letter
of a listbox item will also focus it.

This is a fork of <iron-list> for <vaadin-grid>'s internal purposes only!
To update:
1. Get the most recent code from https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-list/
2. Remove the  <dom-module id="iron-list"> to avoid collisions with actual <iron-list>
3. Change "Polymer({" to "window.PolymerIronList = Polymer.Class({" to expose the class
4. Optional: Remove all properties and functions not needed by <vaadin-grid>
5. Profit!

Material design: [Floating Action Button](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html)

`paper-fab` is a floating action button. It contains an image placed in the center and
comes in two sizes: regular size and a smaller size by applying the attribute `mini`. When
the user touches the button, a ripple effect emanates from the center of the button.

You may import `iron-icons` to use with this element, or provide a URL to a custom icon.
See `iron-iconset` for more information about how to use a custom icon set.

Example:

    <link href="path/to/iron-icons/iron-icons.html" rel="import">

    <paper-fab icon="add"></paper-fab>
    <paper-fab mini icon="favorite"></paper-fab>
    <paper-fab src="star.png"></paper-fab>


### Styling

The following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:

Custom property | Description | Default
----------------|-------------|----------
`--paper-fab-background` | The background color of the button | `--accent-color`
`--paper-fab-keyboard-focus-background` | The background color of the button when focused | `--paper-pink-900`
`--paper-fab-disabled-background` | The background color of the button when it's disabled | `--paper-grey-300`
`--paper-fab-disabled-text` | The text color of the button when it's disabled | `--paper-grey-500`
`--paper-fab` | Mixin applied to the button | `{}`
`--paper-fab-mini` | Mixin applied to a mini button | `{}`
`--paper-fab-disabled` | Mixin applied to a disabled button | `{}`
`--paper-fab-iron-icon` | Mixin applied to the iron-icon within the button | `{}`
`--paper-fab-label` | Mixin applied to the label within the button | `{}`
